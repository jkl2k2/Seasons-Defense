## Scenes

- Located in */Seasons\ Defense/Assets/Scenes*
- You may edit a scene which you claim as your own
	- Naming convention: *FirstnameScene*
- Pull content from others' scenes as you see fit
- Creating a prefab for each object in the scene helps to reduce conflicts
	- Scene will reference the prefab file rather than the object itself

## Prefabs

- Please make clear which prefabs you are utilizing
- Highly circulated prefabs should only be changed when absolutely necessary
- If changes to a claimed prefab are desired, please post a card on the Trello with the requested changes

## Reviewing / Merging Requests

- All files should be proof read and easy to follow without needing to reach out for clarity
- Conventions for naming variables, functions, classes, etc. should be followed as Unity and Rider/VS state
	- If conflicts arise, reach out and we will decide on a convention for the project
- Unnecessary files or objects should not be committed with a PR, and a request will be made to delete them
- Keep requests related to the task being completed and try not to deviate too far from that goal to maintain clarity and team awareness
